The head of analytics is back. He has now prepared a much larger dataset that provides information on a local bank's marketing campaign. 
Our task is to predict whether someone will open a savings account. You will find more details about the dataset in the data section.


This project has 3 parts: 1) Building the best model you can and testing it in Kaggle (The final Pynb File),  2) Reporting your thinking through an executive summary (PPT File), and
3) the Outcome file (submission file)

Model Evaluation
We will evaluate models using Area under ROC (AUC).

AUC is commonly used to compare model accuracy. The maximum value that can be achieved is 1 (perfect model/classifier). 
An AUC value of 0.5 means that it performs equally to a random classifier. An AUC below a value of 0.5 means your model performs worse than a random one. 



Submission files is .csv files. They have to contain two columns: Id and outcome. 
Every customer in the given dataset has a unique customer ID under the Id column, as you can obtain it from the test.csv file.
where outcome is the predicted probability of being class 1 (opened saving account) and idis the customer ID. 



Executive Summary PPT: It includes the following topics:
1. Data understanding (visualization, etc.)
2. Data preparation (variable treatment, feature creation)
3. Modeling (what model did we use)
4. Evaluation methodology (how did we evaluate our model)
5. Managerial implications




Dataset Description:
We have two datasets. train.csv is for training your model, and test.csv contains the information to predict. The submission has to be strictly in the format indicated in the sample_submission.csv.

Dataset description:
Files
train.csv - the training set
test.csv - the test set
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format (Note that the outcome has to be the class probabilities)
